# This is ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶AttuneðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

Attune is a Progressive Web Application that uses data from the Spotify API to match users based on their listening history using a Jaccardian similarity index.

## How to use

You can use Attune on desktop or mobile, but it is best experienced on mobile.
* Go to http://attune.fun
* Click 'login with Spotify' to register.
* Hit the record icon in your footer to open the drawer app
* Customize your bio, see your matches, follow users, or message users!

## Configuration on local machine

Create a GitHub repo and clone it. After you have a repo on your machine:

```sh
npm install

create a secrets directory with a file that contains your own firebase auth info (we named ours something similar to "attune-firebase-admin.js")

create another file in the secrets directory that contains your own Spotify auth info (we named ours "spotify.js")

npm run dev
```

App will be running on localhost:1337

And then you'll have me! If I change â€“ which I probably will â€“ you can get the most recent
version by doing this again:

```sh
git fetch attune
git merge attune/master
```


## My anatomy

`/app` has the React setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/fire` has the Firebase config.

`/functions` is where your [cloud functions](https://firebase.google.com/preview/functions/write-firebase-functions) live.

`/bin` has scripts.

`/public` has all visual assets

## Conventions

I use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files.

I use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code.

I use two spaces, no semi-colons, and generally prefer a less strict version of
[NPM's funny coding style](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style).
